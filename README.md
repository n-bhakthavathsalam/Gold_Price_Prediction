# Gold Price Prediction

![Gold Price Prediction](gold_price_prediction.jpg)

## Overview

This repository contains code for predicting the future prices of gold based on historical data. The code uses machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can estimate gold prices given certain features and historical trends.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is provided in the "data" directory. It contains historical gold price data with various features, such as time, market trends, economic indicators, and other factors that can influence gold prices.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:

- Python (version >= 3.6)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/n-bhakthavathsalam/Gold_Price_Prediction.git
cd Gold_Price_Prediction

markdown
Copy code

2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

bash
Copy code

3. Run the Python script to train and test the predictive model:
python gold_price_prediction.py

vbnet
Copy code

## Algorithm

The predictive model uses a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Time Series Forecasting, LSTM, etc.) to learn patterns from the training data and predict gold prices based on historical trends and other relevant features. The code includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation steps to ensure accurate predictions.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The evaluation results and relevant plots are displayed in the console and saved in the "results" directory.

## Results

The final predicted gold prices and their corresponding actual prices are saved in a CSV file named "predictions.csv" in the "results" directory.
